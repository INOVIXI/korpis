# The CLI and Declarative Workflow

**Status:** design
**Date:** 2026-08-07
**Depends on:** [`10-api.md`](./10-api.md), [`03-state.md`](./03-state.md), [`08-identity.md`](./08-identity.md)
**Implements:** Principles P2, P5, P6

---

## 1. The CLI is the reference client

`korpis` is one binary, calls only the published API, and is the client against which P2 is
mechanically enforced: **every API operation has a command, and no command has a private endpoint.**
Coverage is checked in CI against the schema, so "the API can do something no client exposes" and
"a client does something the API cannot" are both build failures rather than opinions.

The daemons — control plane and node agent — are separate binaries with their own operational
surface, covered in `18-operations.md`. This document is about the client.

---

## 2. Two ways to say the same thing

```
korpis workload restart mc-survival        imperative — one object, right now
korpis apply -f servers/                   declarative — a set of objects, converge
```

Both produce an `Intent`. Both produce a `Plan`. Both appear in the same audit trail. The imperative
form is a convenience over the declarative one, not a second path through the system, which is why
the two cannot drift apart the way `kubectl edit` and a GitOps controller do.

Human output by default; `--json` emits **the API's own object shape**, not a CLI-specific rendering.
Nothing exists in the JSON that a program calling the API directly would not receive, so a script
that outgrows the CLI does not have to be rewritten to move to the SDK. Exit codes are meaningful and
map to the error codes of §8 of `10-api.md` — `DENIED`, `CONFLICT`, and `UNSATISFIABLE` are
distinguishable without parsing text.

---

## 3. Declared files are intent bodies

A declared file is the intent body. There is no wrapper, no `apiVersion`, no `kind` repeated in every
document, no metadata block that exists to satisfy a machine:

```yaml
# servers/mc-survival.yaml
workload: mc-survival
project: community-servers
recipe:  ghcr.io/korpis/recipes/minecraft-paper@sha256:9d2f…
lifecycle: persistent
console: interactive
resources:
  memory: { reservation: 4Gi, limit: 6Gi }
  cpu:    { reservation: 2 }
volumes:
  - name: world
    size: 40Gi
    class: replicated
endpoints:
  - name: game
    port: 25565
    exposure: stable
config:
  motd: "Survival · season 4"
  difficulty: hard
```

The file is validated against the recipe's config schema (§5 of `09-recipes.md`) **before** anything
is sent, so a typo in a field name is a local error with a line number rather than a rejected request.

---

## 4. Plan is the diff, and it is the real one

```
korpis plan -f servers/
```

This is the place the model pays for itself. `kubectl diff` computes a difference on the client and
shows you a text comparison of two YAML documents; what the cluster will actually do remains a
guess. Here, `plan` sends the declaration and receives the **real, persisted `Plan` object** — the
same object the web panel would show, computed by the same code that will execute it, including
placement decisions, `Explanation`s, quota effects, and estimated unavailability.

```
Plan pl_3c81 · 3 changes

  ~ mc-survival        memory 4Gi → 6Gi          restart required, ~40s, 14 players connected
  + mc-creative        create on node fra-3      fra-3: most free memory after packing (see: korpis explain pl_3c81 mc-creative)
  - mc-testing         delete                    volume "world" 12Gi will be RETAINED
                                                 (pass --delete-volumes to remove)

quota  community-servers   memory 18Gi → 24Gi of 32Gi

apply with:  korpis apply -f servers/ --plan pl_3c81
```

Applying a Plan by identifier applies **that** Plan. If the world moved in between, apply returns
`CONFLICT` (§6 of `10-api.md`) and shows the new Plan, rather than silently executing something the
operator never read. A plan reviewed in a pull request is therefore the plan that runs.

---

## 5. Pruning without the footgun

The unsolved problem in every declarative tool: what happens to an object that was removed from the
files. Guess wrong and you either accumulate orphans forever or delete a customer's world directory
because someone renamed a file.

**A declared set has an owner, and removal from the set is a proposal, never an act.**

```
korpis apply -f servers/ --set community-servers
```

Objects created through a set are marked with it. An object that was in the set and is no longer in
the files appears in the Plan as a deletion, enumerated by name — never summarized as "3 objects
pruned" — and:

- Deleting a workload is permitted by an ordinary apply.
- **Deleting anything that holds data is not.** Volumes, snapshots, and backups are retained by
  default and require `--delete-volumes` naming them explicitly. §5 of `06-storage.md` gives volumes
  a `min_retention` floor, and the CLI cannot override it.
- An object that never belonged to the set is never touched by it, so two sets cannot fight and a
  hand-created workload cannot be pruned by someone else's pipeline.

## 6. Two sources of truth, reconciled honestly

Files declare intent. So does the web panel, and so does Discord. Pretending otherwise produces the
GitOps failure everyone has lived through: someone fixes an outage through the UI at 03:00 and a
controller silently reverts it four minutes later.

Every `Intent` carries `managed_by`. When an intent owned by a declared set is changed out of band,
the behaviour is declared per set:

| Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `advisory` (default) | the out-of-band change stands; the set is marked **drifted**, the drift is shown in the panel and in `korpis status`, and the next `plan` shows it as a change to be reconciled or adopted |
| `strict` | the next apply reconciles it back, and the override that was discarded is recorded as an `Effect` with its author, so it is recoverable and attributable |

Neither mode ever silently loses a human's emergency fix. `advisory` is the default because the 03:00
fix is usually right, and a system that punishes people for fixing outages gets worked around within
a month.

---

## 7. Authority, and why CI is the good case

No long-lived admin key in a dotfile. Interactive login is a browser or device-code flow that yields
a short-lived capability token held in the OS keyring.

For automation, §3 of `08-identity.md` does something RBAC systems cannot:

```
korpis grant issue \
  --actions workload.read,workload.write \
  --scope   project:community-servers \
  --expires 90d \
  --label   "github actions · korpis-community/servers"
```

That token can deploy one project, expires on a date, appears in every `Effect` it authorizes, and —
because grants only ever produce weaker children (P6) — **cannot be used to mint a broader one.** A
leaked CI secret in this market is normally an admin key; here it is a bounded, dated, attributable
delegation, and revoking it is revoking one row.

Shell completion resolves against what the caller can actually read, for the same reason Discord's
autocomplete does (§8 of `12-surface-discord.md`): existence follows read authority, so completion
cannot become a name-disclosure oracle.

---

## 8. The interactive commands

```
korpis console mc-survival           attach to the durable stream; scrollback, seek, replay
korpis logs mc-survival --since 1h   read without attaching
korpis exec mc-survival -- /bin/sh   a session, subject to the runtime's isolation tier
korpis files sync ./world w:mc-survival/world    delta transfer, direct to node
korpis forward mc-survival:25565     local port through the overlay, no public exposure
korpis watch -f servers/             stream plans and effects as they occur
```

`files sync` transfers directly to the node with a short-lived scoped token rather than through the
control plane, for the same reason web upload does (§8 of `11-surface-web.md`): a 40 GB world should
not traverse the control plane, and the control plane should not be a data path.

`exec` is not universally available and does not pretend to be. §4.3 of `04-runtimes.md` forbids the
driver interface from assuming a shared filesystem or a POSIX process model, so `exec` exists where
the driver declares the capability and returns `UNSATISFIABLE`, naming the reason, where it does not.
The alternative — a command that silently means different things on different tiers — is worse.

## 9. Open questions

1. **Multi-context.** `kubeconfig` is widely disliked and universally copied. A single context with
   explicit `--server` flags may be enough given that most operators run one control plane, but a
   consultant with ten clients is a real user. → here
2. **Config file format and location.** Follows from the above. → here
3. **CLI plugins.** `korpis-foo` on `PATH` becoming `korpis foo` is cheap and gives extensions a CLI
   surface for free, but it also creates a path-hijacking vector worth thinking through. →
   `16-extensions.md`
4. **Templating in declared files.** Every declarative tool grows one — Helm, Kustomize, jsonnet —
   and every one is regretted. Recipes already provide typed, schema-validated parameterization
   (§5 of `09-recipes.md`), so the honest answer may be that the CLI needs none, and the files are
   plain data. → `09-recipes.md`
5. **Plan signing.** A Plan approved in a pull request and applied by a pipeline would ideally carry a
   signature binding the approval to the exact plan. That is an approval-workflow feature and belongs
   with governance rather than being invented here. → `19-governance.md`
