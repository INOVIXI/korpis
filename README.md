# Korpis

**A workload platform for machines you control. Design specification.**

Korpis runs anything with a lifecycle — a game server, a bot, a web service, a database, a scheduled
job, a virtual machine — on hardware you own. It places the workload on a node, isolates it as
strongly as you ask, gives it storage and network, keeps it in the state you declared, and lets you
and the people you delegate to operate it from a panel, a terminal, chat, or the API.

> **There is no code yet. This repository is the design.**
>
> Twenty-four documents, and they are the deliverable. Some decisions in a system like this cannot be
> retrofitted — how state is stored, how authority is delegated, where the security boundary sits,
> what the agent protocol promises. Getting those wrong on paper costs a paragraph. Getting them
> wrong in month nine costs a rewrite, which is a thing that has already happened to this category of
> software more than once.

## What it does differently

**Declares, never commands.** You say what should be true. Korpis converges reality toward it,
continuously, and reports what is actually true. No component tells another to do something and
assumes it worked — which is where "the panel says stopped but the server is running" comes from.

**Makes the diff a real object.** Every change produces an inspectable `Plan` before it produces an
`Effect`. Dry-run, approvals, scheduled changes, rollback, and an audit trail that cannot lie are
consequences of that single decision rather than five separate features.

**Has no roles.** Authority is a *grant* — a subject, some actions, a scope, some conditions — and a
grant can only ever produce weaker children. So "this link lets your friend restart this one server
for the next 24 hours, no account needed" is an ordinary operation, and reselling is something the
model does for free rather than a feature anyone writes.

**Lets you choose the isolation.** `process`, `container`, `microvm`, `vm`, per workload, behind one
driver interface. Each tier is documented by what it does *not* stop as much as by what it does,
because a tier that looks like isolation and isn't is worse than one honestly labelled weaker.

**Never claims what it doesn't enforce.** Every displayed limit is enforced by the kernel and
metered. Every status is observed. When Korpis can't see something it says `unknown` instead of
guessing, and when it drops data it leaves a marked gap instead of a clean-looking hole.

**Doesn't tax growth.** No per-workload, per-node, per-instance, per-account, or per-domain charge,
at any scale, ever. No editions, no gated features, no commercial-use restriction.

## Start here

**[`00-overview.md`](./00-overview.md)** — what Korpis is, what it deliberately is *not*, ten ordered
principles, four falsifiable bets, and nineteen rules derived from evidence.

Then whichever of these you actually care about:

| Question | Document |
|---|---|
| Does the model hold together? | [`01-model.md`](./01-model.md) · [`02-architecture.md`](./02-architecture.md) · [`03-state.md`](./03-state.md) |
| Is it safe? | [`17-security.md`](./17-security.md) · [`04-runtimes.md`](./04-runtimes.md) · [`08-identity.md`](./08-identity.md) |
| **Does it survive contact with reality?** | [`23-walkthroughs.md`](./23-walkthroughs.md) — seven scenarios traced end to end, and the nine defects that found |
| Could I run it? | [`18-operations.md`](./18-operations.md) |
| Could I build on it? | [`10-api.md`](./10-api.md) · [`16-extensions.md`](./16-extensions.md) · [`09-recipes.md`](./09-recipes.md) |
| What gets built first? | [`20-roadmap.md`](./20-roadmap.md) |
| Who decides things? | [`19-governance.md`](./19-governance.md) |
| Why any of this? | [`research/evidence.md`](./research/evidence.md) |

Full map in §7 of the overview.

**The open questions are the point, not the gaps.** About forty are recorded across the documents,
each one filed in the document that will settle it. A deferred decision with a name on it is honest.
An undeclared one is a trap someone walks into later.

## How this was written

**By one person, with Claude.** That is worth saying plainly rather than leaving for someone to
notice.

Nobody should take a specification on trust because of who or what produced it, so here is what was
actually done to make it worth reading:

- **Every deviation is argued from something citable.** The rules in §6 of the overview each trace to
  a published advisory, a specific issue, or documented product behaviour, collected in
  [`research/evidence.md`](./research/evidence.md) with confidence tags — sources that turned out to
  be SEO content are marked as such and not relied on.
- **The design was attacked on purpose.** [`23-walkthroughs.md`](./23-walkthroughs.md) traces seven
  concrete scenarios across every layer they touch, looking specifically for the step where no
  document is holding the ball. It found nine defects, including a quota race, a console that
  silently failed to migrate, and revoked authority that could resurrect after a restore. All nine
  are fixed, and the walkthrough documents them rather than quietly patching them.
- **Corrections are left visible.** §2 of [`01-model.md`](./01-model.md) is a record of an earlier
  proposal in this repository being wrong and why. Nothing is presented as having been obvious.

The judgement calls, the priorities, and the mistakes are the author's. If something here is wrong,
it is wrong on its own terms — open an issue and say so.

## Contributing

The most useful thing anyone can do right now is **argue with it**. A specification that has never
been disagreed with has not been reviewed.

Especially wanted:

- Somewhere the reasoning doesn't hold, or an assumption that isn't stated
- An operational failure mode the walkthroughs missed
- Anything in [`research/evidence.md`](./research/evidence.md) that is inaccurate or unfair — accuracy
  matters more here than being right
- Experience running this class of software at scale, which no amount of design substitutes for

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md). Security policy: [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).

| Control plane, node agent, web / CLI / chat clients | **AGPL-3.0** |

Plainly, because AGPL gets misread as a restriction on use: **run it commercially, sell capacity on
it, charge what you like, build closed extensions against it — you owe nothing.** The obligation
appears only if you modify Korpis itself and offer the modified version over a network, in which case
you publish those modifications.
