# Extensions

## 1. Why this is not optional

Pterodactyl has no extension API. The ecosystem that grew anyway standardized on patching core PHP
files with `sed`, an approach that breaks on every upgrade, cannot be audited, cannot be
uninstalled cleanly, and makes the panel's own release cadence a hazard to its users.

That is not a community failing. It is what people do when the alternative is not existing. The
extension interface has to be designed before there are consumers for it, because after there are
consumers, the patching convention is already load-bearing.

---

## 2. Core uses the same mechanism

P8's falsifiable claim: **if the extension interface is not sufficient for core features, it does
not ship.** These are extensions in Korpis, not core code with an extension API bolted beside it:

| Extension | Point |
|---|---|
| game query protocols (Source, Minecraft, GameSpy) | health provider |
| RCON, and console adapters for non-stdout consoles | console provider |
| Steam app installation (`steam.app` install step) | recipe step provider |
| DNS providers (Cloudflare, Route53, RFC 2136) | DNS provider |
| object-storage backup targets | backup target provider |
| OIDC, SAML, LDAP identity sources | identity provider |
| protocol-aware routers (Minecraft handshake, TLS SNI) | edge router provider |
| alert routing beyond the built-in minimum | event consumer |
| **the Discord client**: and the chat-adapter interface behind it | actions + events + streams |

Every one of these was previously named in another document as "an extension" precisely so that
this list could be checked rather than asserted. If any of them turns out to need a core change,
the interface is wrong and the interface gets fixed, not the exception granted.

---

## 3. An extension is a workload

Korpis runs itself.

An extension is packaged as an OCI artifact, distributed and signed exactly like a recipe (§2 of
`09-recipes.md`), and executed as a `Workload` on a node, with an isolation tier, a resource
reservation, declared egress, and a lease. It has a `Subject` and holds grants. It cannot read the
database, cannot open a socket the control plane trusts implicitly, and cannot touch a Korpis file.

This is not cleverness for its own sake. It means an extension gets the entire platform's
isolation, scheduling, observability, quota, and audit machinery for free, and it means a
misbehaving extension is a misbehaving workload, a category the system already knows how to
contain, throttle, restart, and evict.

It also means the answer to "can an extension take down my control plane" is the same as the answer
to "can a tenant's game server take down my node", which is a question this design has already
spent `04-runtimes.md` and `17-security.md` answering.

---

## 4. Permissions are grants, declared and granted at install

An extension declares what it needs. The operator sees the list and approves it. From then on it
acts as itself, in the audit trail, under grants that attenuate like everyone else's.

```
extension: cloudflare-dns
  needs:
    endpoint.read        scope: organization
    dns.record.write     scope: zones it is configured for
    event.read           filter: endpoint.*
  egress:
    api.cloudflare.com:443
```

This is the phone-application permission model, and it works here for the reason it fails in most
server software: grants already exist, so there is nothing to invent. A user can see what an
extension may do by reading its grants, revoke one without uninstalling, and read every action it
took in the same `Effect` log everything else writes to (§4 of `15-observability.md`).

An extension can never hold authority its installer did not have, because a grant only produces
weaker children (P6). A reseller installing an extension inside their own organization cannot
thereby obtain reach into a sibling organization, and this requires no check; it is structurally
impossible.

### 4.1 Who may install one, in a delegated tree

> Finding 7 of `23-walkthroughs.md`.

With three levels (operator, reseller, customer) "the operator approves" names three different
people. The instinct is to add an approval object. That instinct is wrong, and the reason is worth
stating because it recurs:

**"It runs code on someone else's machine" proves too much.** Tenants already run arbitrary code;
that is the product. A Minecraft server with forty forum-sourced plugins is arbitrary code, and an
extension is a workload in the same isolation tier, under the same quota, subject to the same
egress policy. From that angle an extension is not more dangerous than what the platform exists to
run.

The real distinction is **which direction the call goes**:

> An extension that Korpis *calls* is infrastructure. An extension that calls Korpis is a tenant.

| Kind | Whose exposure | Who may install |
|---|---|---|
| event consumer, action, UI slot | the installer's own data and quota | **the installer**, their grants already suffice |
| **provider**: DNS, backup target, identity, edge router | the control path; Korpis calls it, waits on it, depends on it | **whoever owns the resource it provides for** |

Tenant-direction extensions need nothing new. Authority is bounded structurally, consumption is
metered against the installer, and egress obeys the tenant's egress policy, so an operator who
forbids arbitrary egress has already stopped the extension from reaching Cloudflare. The lever
exists.

Provider-direction extensions need no new object either, because the answer is **scope**: a DNS
provider is installable by whoever owns the zone, a backup target by whoever owns the repository,
an identity provider by whoever owns the organization it authenticates into, an edge router by
whoever owns the edge. A reseller runs a DNS provider for their own zones and cannot place code in
the operator's forwarding path.

Separately and optionally, an operator may keep a **publisher or registry allow-list**, the same
mechanism §13.4 of `17-security.md` proposes for recipes, default open. A shared-hosting provider
may not want customers installing arbitrary extensions at all; that is their policy to set, not our
default to impose.

## 5. Four extension points

### Event consumers

Subscribe to the event stream, filtered by grant. Delivery is at-least-once with a persistent
outbox; consumers are expected to be idempotent, and the delivery identifier makes that easy. A
slow or dead consumer's queue is bounded and is dropped with a visible marker rather than growing
until it becomes the control plane's problem.

### Providers

Korpis calls **out** to the extension to obtain a capability it does not implement: resolve a DNS
record, run a health probe, install a Steam application, write a backup to an object store, verify
an identity assertion, route a protocol.

Calling out is the direction that carries risk, so the contract is strict:

- Every provider call has a deadline. There is no unbounded wait on third-party code.
- Failure behaviour is **declared per provider type**, never guessed. A DNS provider that is
  unreachable does not block a workload from starting; the endpoint's observation becomes
  `unsatisfiable` with the reason attached, and reconciliation retries, the same treatment §7 of
  `05-scheduling.md` gives every other unsatisfiable condition. An identity provider that is
  unreachable fails closed, because failing open there is an authentication bypass.
- Providers are circuit-broken. A provider failing consistently is marked down, its dependents are
  marked `unsatisfiable` with the provider named, and it is retried on a backoff, instead of every
  reconciliation loop in the fleet queueing behind it.
- **The breaker trips on latency as well as on failure**, and provider concurrency is bounded per
  provider rather than per call.

> Finding 23 of `23-walkthroughs.md`.

The last point exists because the first three all describe a provider that is broken, and the
expensive failure mode is a provider that works. A DNS provider answering correctly at ninety per
cent of a five-second deadline, every time, for every workload in the fleet, produces no error to
trip anything while consuming the reconciler's throughput. **A deadline bounds one call and says
nothing about aggregate cost.**

So latency is measured and published per provider, sustained latency trips the breaker the same way
sustained failure does, and a bounded concurrency per provider means one slow dependency occupies a
slice of reconciliation capacity rather than all of it. `15-observability.md` §5 carries the
`provider_degraded` event, because the operator whose creates got slow this morning should not have
to infer the cause from a graph.

The tenant boundary already holds here and is worth naming: a provider installed by one tenant is
bounded by the grants it was installed with (§4.1), so a slow tenant-installed provider degrades
that tenant's own reconciliation and nobody else's. The fleet-wide case is a provider installed at
the operator level, which is exactly what §2 means by core using the same mechanism, and it is the
price of that decision rather than an accident.

### Actions and commands

An extension registers actions in the `ext.<name>.<action>` namespace (§5 of `10-api.md`). Because
the web, Discord, and CLI surfaces are generated from the schema, a registered action **appears in
all three automatically** (as a button, a slash command, and a subcommand) with autocomplete,
authorization, Plan rendering, and audit already attached.

This is the payoff for P2 being enforced rather than promised. In every competing product, an
extension that wants a Discord command writes a Discord bot.

### UI slots

Declared, typed, and named. An extension contributes to a slot; it does not edit the bundle, and
there is no supported way for it to.

Most contributions are **declarative descriptors**, a form driven by a schema, a table driven by a
query, a status card, a settings section. These render in the panel's own components, so they
inherit its theming, accessibility, mobile layout, and its three-state rendering of unknown values
(§2 of `11-surface-web.md`).

For genuinely custom UI there is an iframe on a **separate origin**, communicating over a typed
`postMessage` channel, under a restrictive CSP. It never receives the user's capability token; it
receives its own, scoped to the extension's grants and the current context. Two things follow that
are worth stating: an extension cannot exfiltrate the user's authority, and an extension cannot
render a convincing fake login prompt inside the panel's own chrome, because it is visibly and
structurally a foreign frame.

Runtime drivers are deliberately **not** in this list. §4.3 of `04-runtimes.md` defines them as
separate processes with their own interface, because a driver's privilege union is different in
kind from an extension's, and pretending otherwise would put the two on the same footing at exactly
the point where they must not be.

## 6. Versioning

The rules of §4 of `10-api.md` apply unchanged: additive only, no renames, no splits, capability
negotiation rather than version sniffing.

An extension declares the API version and the capabilities it requires. **Incompatibility is
detected at load, refused with a message naming what is missing, and never discovered at first
use**, the alternative being an extension that installs cleanly and fails six weeks later during an
incident.

The support window is the same N-2 as the agent protocol, and for the same reason: extensions live
on machines and in registries that Korpis does not control, and an upgrade that silently orphans an
operator's DNS provider is an outage the operator did not choose.

---

## 7. What extensions cannot do

Stated as a list because the boundary is the design:

- read or write the database
- modify, replace, or read Korpis' own files
- hold authority exceeding their installer's
- receive another subject's capability token
- run in the control plane's process, address space, or privilege
- add a field to a core object: they carry their own state, keyed by core identifiers
- block a reconciliation loop indefinitely
- disable, weaken, or bypass a grant condition
- remove a recipe-declared redaction pattern (§7 of `14-streams.md`)

The last two matter because an extension is often installed by an operator on behalf of tenants,
and the tenant is not always the party being protected from.

---

## 8. Distribution

OCI artifacts in ordinary registries, addressed by digest, signed with cosign, identical to recipes
(§2 and §7 of `09-recipes.md`), for the identical reason: registries already provide hosting,
mirroring, signing, and CDN, and Korpis is not a marketplace (§2 of `00-overview.md`).

Extensions are licensed at their authors' choice (§5 of `00-overview.md`). **Paid, proprietary
extensions are explicitly permitted**, and this is deliberate: P10 removes the platform tax, and P8
gives a commercial host the supported place to build proprietary differentiation. A market where
the platform is free and the specialized extensions are sold is the outcome this design is aiming
at, and it is what the AGPL/Apache split in §5 of `00-overview.md` exists to make possible.

---

## 9. Open questions

1. **Hot reload versus restart.** An extension is a workload, so replacing it is a rolling update,
   which is already solved. Whether a *provider* can be replaced without dependents seeing a
   failure window needs the drain semantics of §3 of `05-scheduling.md` applied to provider
   registration. → `05-scheduling.md`
2. **Extension-to-extension dependency.** A game-query extension and a Discord-notification
   extension composing is natural, and a dependency graph invites version-resolution complexity
   that has eaten larger projects. Possibly the answer is that they compose only through the event
   stream and the API, never directly. → here
3. **CLI plugins.** Carried from §9 of `13-surface-cli.md`. `korpis-foo` on `PATH` is cheap and is
   a path-hijacking vector. → here
4. **UI slot inventory.** Which slots exist is a real design surface, too few and extensions patch
   around them, too many and the panel cannot be restyled. It should be driven by what the core
   extensions in §2 actually need, and no slot should be added without a consumer. →
   `11-surface-web.md`
5. **Chat adapters. Resolved: extensions, and the Discord client is one of them.** Settled in §10
   of `12-surface-discord.md`. It is the strongest single test of §2's claim (an extension that is
   a complete client, not a peripheral) which is why it is worth building through the contract even
   though building it in-core would be easier. What remains genuinely open is how much of the
   widget vocabulary the adapter interface can carry across platforms, and that is answered by
   writing the second adapter, not by designing harder. → here
