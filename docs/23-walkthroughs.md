# Walkthroughs

**Status:** design **Date:** 2026-08-07 **Depends on:** every preceding document

---

## 0. What this document is

Twenty-three documents, each internally consistent. That is not the same as working together.

Designs do not fail inside a document. They fail **between** documents, where one says "this is
handled in the storage layer" and the storage layer never heard about it. Per-document review
cannot find those, because each document reads correctly on its own.

So: fourteen concrete scenarios, traced end to end through every layer they touch. The output is
not a tutorial. It is a **defect list**, and it is written to be adversarial, the goal of each
trace is to find the step where nobody is holding the ball.

**Fourteen traces produced twenty-three findings, and all of them are now closed** and patched into
the documents they belong to, the table in §15 says where each landed. Each cost a paragraph to fix
here. Finding them in month nine would have cost a rewrite.

§16 records a separate external review that attacked the documents' internal algebra rather than
the seams between them, and found sixteen more.

The first seven follow one workload through its life: created, migrated, orphaned by a dead node,
delegated, attacked, restored, upgraded. That is one axis, and after they were written the coverage
was measurably lopsided: `05-scheduling.md` was crossed seventeen times and `13-surface-cli.md` not
once. The next seven were chosen by that measurement rather than by intuition, and they follow the
things that surround a workload instead: the meter, the backup, the pipeline, the identity
provider, the package, the edge, and the extension on the critical path. They produced more
findings than the first seven did, which is what an untraced surface is supposed to do.

## 1. Creating a workload, and sharing it

**Trace**

| # | Step | Governed by |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Subject declares a workload; grant checked at declaration | `08-identity.md` §3 |
| 2 | Recipe reference `…:1.20` resolved to a digest, **recorded in the intent** | `09-recipes.md` §8 |
| 3 | Config validated against the recipe's schema, per-field permissions applied | `09-recipes.md` §5 |
| 4 | Quota checked | `05-scheduling.md` §5 |
| 5 | Placement: filter → score → bind, `Explanation` recorded | `05-scheduling.md` §2 |
| 6 | Plan persisted; low-risk, so applied directly and shown after | `11-surface-web.md` §4 |
| 7 | `Intent` v1 written, `Effect` in the same transaction | `03-state.md` §3.1, §4 |
| 8 | Agent receives the assigned intent set | `02-architecture.md` §4.1 |
| 9 | `Prepare`, content fetched by digest, signature verified, **pure** | `04-runtimes.md` §4.2 |
| 10 | Volume created with byte and inode quota in the write path | `06-storage.md` §3 |
| 11 | Endpoint allocated, exposure mode applied | `07-networking.md` §3 |
| 12 | `Create`, then `Start` | `04-runtimes.md` §4.2 |
| 13 | Health probed at the application level | `04-runtimes.md` §5 |
| 14 | `Observation` written by the agent, `intent_seen` advances | `02-architecture.md` §4.3 |
| 15 | Web shows converging, then converged, with the lag | `11-surface-web.md` §3 |
| 16 | Owner issues a share grant; token travels in the fragment | `08-identity.md` §6.1 |

**FINDING 1: Quota is checked, but not held. `CONFIRMED`**

Step 4 checks quota; step 7 writes the intent. `10-api.md` §6 protects the *workload* with
compare-and-swap on `expected_version`, and that is the wrong object: quota is a property of the
organization, not of the workload being created. Two concurrent creates in the same organization
each check 24 Gi of 32 Gi used, each pass, and both commit, 8 Gi over.

This is not exotic. It is a customer clicking twice, a Discord command racing a web action, or a
pipeline creating a batch.

**Resolution.** Quota consumption is written in the same transaction as the intent, against a row
whose version participates in the CAS, the quota entry, not the workload, is the contended object.
A quota check that does not take a lock on what it is checking is a race, and the honest name for
the current design is "advisory quota", which P4 forbids displaying. → patch `05-scheduling.md`
§5.1 and `03-state.md` §3.2

**FINDING 2: A Plan's steps have no stated atomicity. `CONFIRMED`**

Steps 10–12 are three durable side effects. If the volume is created and endpoint allocation fails,
what exists? `05-scheduling.md` §3 gives `Operation` ordered steps across *many* workloads, and P9
promises every operation is resumable and reversible, but nothing states the semantics for the
steps *within* a single workload's plan.

**Resolution.** A Plan's steps are ordered, individually idempotent, and resumable from the last
completed step; a failed plan leaves a workload in a state the model can represent, which is what
P9's "no operation may leave a workload in a state the model cannot represent" already demands and
never operationalizes. Partial resources are retained and named in the observation, never orphaned
silently. This is the same treatment `02-architecture.md` §4.4 gives adopted runtime objects. →
patch `05-scheduling.md` §3

*Confirmed correct in this trace:* recipe digest resolved **once, centrally, at step 2** rather
than per node, two agents cannot resolve the same tag differently. This was the seam I expected to
find and `09-recipes.md` §8 already closes it.

---

## 2. Migrating a busy server

**Trace**

| # | Step | Governed by |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Operator drains a node; `Operation` with `max_unavailable` | `05-scheduling.md` §3 |
| 2 | Per workload: destination chosen, `Explanation` recorded | `05-scheduling.md` §2 |
| 3 | Volume snapshot; incremental transfer while running | `06-storage.md` §8 |
| 4 | Final incremental with the workload paused | `05-scheduling.md` §8 |
| 5 | **Cutover:** source lease epoch fenced, destination started | `02-architecture.md` §4.5 |
| 6 | Edge forwarding target updated in the same step | `07-networking.md` §3.1, §10 |
| 7 | Meter cut at that instant, no reset, no double count | `15-observability.md` §2 |
| 8 | Players reconnect to the same address | none |

**FINDING 3: The console does not migrate. `CONFIRMED`**

`14-streams.md` §4 puts segment files in the tenant's storage on the node, and the agent owns all
three tiers. Nothing in the migration sequence moves them. So a workload migrates and its
scrollback stays behind on a machine that is about to be decommissioned, and §1 of that same
document argues at length that the console is *evidence*, not a widget.

Worse: offsets are per-stream and monotonic. If the stream restarts on the destination, either
offsets restart (breaking every reader's resume) or the destination must know where the source
stopped.

**Resolution.** The stream is part of the workload's durable state and migrates with the volume, in
the same incremental transfer. The destination continues the offset sequence, which it can only do
if the final offset crosses in the cutover message, so the offset watermark joins the lease epoch
as something the cutover carries. Any range that could not be transferred is a **gap record**, so a
migrated console is honest about what it lost. → patch `14-streams.md` §4 and `05-scheduling.md` §8

**FINDING 4: A client attached to the console during cutover. `PLAUSIBLE`**

The reader is connected to the source node with a scoped token. At cutover the source is fenced.
The reader sees the connection drop.

This is probably correct behaviour and does not need machinery, the reader reconnects, is directed
to the destination, and resumes at its last offset, which Finding 3's resolution makes possible. It
is recorded because it is only correct *given* Finding 3; without it, the reader resumes at an
offset that means something different. → verify after patching

---

## 3. A node dies

**Trace**

| # | Step | Governed by |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Agent stops reporting; node marked `unreachable` | `02-architecture.md` §9 |
| 2 | Observations become `unknown`, never a stale value shown as current | `11-surface-web.md` §2 |
| 3 | Lease expires; `on_expiry` decides `keep_running` or `stop` | `02-architecture.md` §4.5 |
| 4 | Metering records a gap with its cause | `15-observability.md` §2 |
| 5 | Workloads on replicated storage are rescheduled | `18-operations.md` §5 |
| 6 | Workloads whose only copy of data was local are **not**, and this is said plainly | `18-operations.md` §5 |
| 7 | On return: adoption by label, epoch checked; if fenced, it cannot resume | `02-architecture.md` §4.4 |

**FINDING 5: What a `stable` address does while its workload is gone. `CONFIRMED`**

The edge owns the address and forwards to a placement that no longer exists. Nothing says what it
does. The three possibilities are meaningfully different to the person connecting: a black hole
(they wait thirty seconds and blame their own connection), a refusal (fast, honest, generic), or a
protocol-aware status (accurate, only for protocols the router understands).

This is exactly the affordance `22-first-party.md` §6 already built for hibernation, a router that
answers a Minecraft ping with "starting, ~30s". An unreachable workload is the same shape of
problem with a different message.

**Resolution.** Default is immediate refusal, never a black hole, a timeout is P4's "unknown"
rendered as a stall. Where a protocol router is present, it answers with the real state:
`hibernated`, `starting`, `unreachable`, or `data unavailable`. → patch `07-networking.md` §3.1

*Confirmed correct:* step 6 is the honest one, and it is already honest. A design that implied
automatic recovery of a workload whose only data copy died would be the most damaging possible lie,
and `18-operations.md` §5 refuses to tell it.

## 4. A reseller's customer's customer

**Trace**

| # | Step | Governed by |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Operator delegates to a reseller: a grant, scoped to an organization | `08-identity.md` §3 |
| 2 | Reseller delegates to a customer, attenuated, never wider | `08-identity.md` §3.2 |
| 3 | Customer delegates to their own moderator | same mechanism, no new code |
| 4 | Quota inherits down the tree | `05-scheduling.md` §5.1 |
| 5 | Metering rolls up; the reseller sees their sub-tree's usage | `15-observability.md` §2 |
| 6 | `Explanation`s filtered per viewer, the customer learns nothing about the node | `08-identity.md` §8 |
| 7 | No reseller feature was written anywhere | Bet 4 |

**FINDING 6: Quota inheritance does not say allocation or usage. `CONFIRMED`, and it decides Bet
4**

A reseller holds 32 Gi. They sell 16 Gi to customer A and 16 Gi to customer B, then want to sell 16
Gi to customer C, because in practice, customers use a fraction of what they buy, and overselling
is not an abuse of this market, it *is* this market.

If child quota consumes parent quota **by allocation**, the reseller is blocked at 32 Gi and Korpis
has forbidden the standard commercial practice of every host it is courting. If it consumes **by
usage**, then quota is not a guarantee and P4 is violated the first time three customers get busy
together.

Neither is acceptable, and the design currently states neither.

**Resolution.** Both, explicitly, per the same distinction `05-scheduling.md` §5.2 already draws
for resources: a quota entry has a **reservation** and a **limit**. Reservations sum against the
parent and cannot be oversubscribed; limits may exceed it, by a declared ratio, and the sum of
limits is visible to whoever set it. A reseller sells 16 Gi limits with 4 Gi reservations and knows
exactly what they have promised versus what they have guaranteed, which is what they are actually
doing today with a spreadsheet.

The overcommit ratio is per-dimension and memory defaults to off, exactly as §5.3 already requires.
Bet 4 survives, and it survives because the mechanism already existed one layer down; it had simply
never been applied to quota. → patch `05-scheduling.md` §5.1

**FINDING 7: Who approves an extension's grants inside a delegated organization. `OPEN`**

`16-extensions.md` §4 says an extension declares what it needs and "the operator" approves. In a
three-level tree there are three parties who could reasonably be called the operator, and an
extension runs as a workload on the *machine owner's* hardware with declared egress.

A reseller's customer installing an extension is asking to run code on someone else's machine. The
grant model already prevents authority escalation, the extension cannot exceed its installer. But
egress, resource consumption, and reputation are the machine owner's exposure, not the installer's.

**Decision needed.** The likely shape is that installation requires the installer's grants *and* an
allow-list controlled by whoever owns the node, defaulting to first-party extensions only. That is
a policy choice with real product consequences, not something to settle inside a walkthrough. →
`16-extensions.md`

## 5. A hostile tenant

**Trace**: each attempt, and what stops it.

| Attempt | Stopped by | Governed by |
|---|---|---|
| `../../etc/shadow` through the file API | `openat2(RESOLVE_BENEATH)` + Landlock; the string is never a decision | `17-security.md` §4 |
| symlink race in an upload | same, the kernel resolves or it does not | `17-security.md` §4 |
| fork bomb | cgroup `pids.max`, no reservation, no way to disable | `05-scheduling.md` §5.2 |
| a million empty files | inode quota | `06-storage.md` §3 |
| 50 MB/s of log output | stream rate limit, drop with gap marker, never blocks the workload, counts against their own quota | `14-streams.md` §4, §5 |
| exhaust the node's conntrack table | per-workload conntrack limit | `07-networking.md` §6 |
| reach `169.254.169.254` | egress default-deny | `07-networking.md` §6 |
| reach a neighbour | network namespace + default-deny | |
| read the daemon's credentials via a template | no ambient scope; a flat pre-resolved variable map | `09-recipes.md` §6 |
| escape the kernel via an LPE | **not stopped** in `process`/`container`; this is why the tier is a choice | `17-security.md` §5 |
| exfiltrate their own operator's secret from a log | redaction at write time, best-effort, labelled as such | `14-streams.md` §7 |

**FINDING 8: Egress policy is enforced by the party being contained. `OPEN`, already known**

`07-networking.md` §11.6 raises it and hands it to `17-security.md`, which does not answer it.
Egress rules are enforced at the source node by that node's agent. A compromised agent can ignore
them, and a compromised agent is explicitly in the adversary table (`17-security.md` §2).

This trace does not resolve it, it confirms the handoff is dangling, which is the same class of
defect as the edge-availability one already fixed. The options are real and costly: enforce at the
edge (latency, a chokepoint), enforce at the destination (only works inside the fleet), or accept
it and state that a compromised node's egress is uncontained. **Decision needed.** →
`17-security.md`

*Otherwise this trace is the strongest in the document.* Every attempt except the kernel LPE meets
a named, specific mechanism, and the LPE is not defended against by anyone and is labelled
honestly.

## 6. Restoring the control plane from backup

**Trace**

| # | Step | Governed by |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Postgres, signing keys, and the epoch watermark restored | `18-operations.md` §6 |
| 2 | **Epoch watermark advanced past every epoch that could have been issued** | `03-state.md` §8 |
| 3 | Control plane starts; agents reconnect | `02-architecture.md` §4 |
| 4 | Each presents its intent-set digest; most match; deltas for the rest | `10-api.md` §9 |
| 5 | Workloads never stopped, they were never dependent on the control plane | `02-architecture.md` §4.6 |

**FINDING 9: Capability tokens outlive the database they were issued from. `CONFIRMED`**

`08-identity.md` §6 makes the grant and the capability token the same object in two
representations, and the agent verifies tokens **offline** against a signing key. That is what
makes the system work during an outage, and it has a consequence nobody wrote down.

Restore to Tuesday's backup. A grant issued Wednesday and revoked Thursday is gone from the
database, but its token is signed by a key that was also restored, so it still verifies. **A
revoked grant is resurrected, silently, and there is no row anywhere saying it exists.** The audit
trail is not merely incomplete; it actively disagrees with reality.

The symmetric case is milder and also wrong: a legitimate grant issued Wednesday keeps working
while the panel shows nothing, so it cannot be revoked through the interface.

**Resolution.** Restore rotates the signing key, exactly as it advances the epoch watermark, and
for the identical reason: a restored control plane must invalidate authority it can no longer
account for. Every token issued after the backup stops verifying, and every session
re-authenticates. The cost is a visible, bounded interruption during a disaster the operator
already knows about; the alternative is silent authority with no record.

Key rotation therefore joins epoch advancement as an **unskippable restore step**, and the token
lifetimes of §6 of `08-identity.md` bound how long the disruption lasts. → patch `03-state.md` §8,
`08-identity.md` §6, `18-operations.md` §6

---

## 7. Upgrading a fleet

**Trace**

| # | Step | Governed by |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Control plane first; migrations forward-only and online | `18-operations.md` §4 |
| 2 | Agents upgraded one at a time, over days if wanted; N-2 window | `10-api.md` §4 |
| 3 | Each agent restarts and **re-adopts running workloads**, no tenant restart | `02-architecture.md` §4.4 |
| 4 | Extensions declaring an incompatible API version are refused at load, with a message | `16-extensions.md` §6 |
| 5 | Mixed-version fleet is a supported steady state, not a window | `18-operations.md` §4 |

**Nothing new found**, and one behaviour worth naming because it is easy to get wrong: an extension
refused at load in step 4 that happens to be a *provider* (a DNS provider, say), leaves its
dependents in `unsatisfiable` with the provider named, which is the same treatment
`16-extensions.md` §5 gives a provider that is merely down. A refused-at-load provider and a
crashed provider produce the same observable state, and that is correct: from a workload's
perspective they are the same event.

`18-operations.md` §10.5 already proposes `korpis upgrade --plan` to surface step 4 *before*
anything moves. This trace is the argument that it is not optional.

## 8. The month closes with six hours missing from the meter

The first seven traces followed one workload through its life. This one and the six after it follow
the things that surround a workload: money, data, the pipeline, the identity provider, the package,
the edge, and the extension on the critical path. Between them they cross the documents the first
seven barely touched.

**Trace**

| # | Step | Governed by |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 22:00 on the 30th: a node loses its uplink. Workloads keep running | `02-architecture.md` §4.6 |
| 2 | The agent keeps sampling from kernel counters, locally | `15-observability.md` §2 |
| 3 | The control plane stops receiving samples and reports the workload's state as `unknown` | P4, `03-state.md` §5 |
| 4 | The control plane records a gap with the cause `node unreachable` | `15-observability.md` §2 |
| 5 | 04:00 on the 1st: the link returns and the agent re-sends six hours of buffered samples | `15-observability.md` §2 |
| 6 | Samples are idempotent by `(workload, resource, interval_start)`, so re-delivery overwrites | `15-observability.md` §2 |
| 7 | The host's billing system reads the month that closed at 00:00 on the 1st | K-12, out of scope by design |

**FINDING 10: A gap and a late sample are two answers to one question. `CONFIRMED`**

Step 4 writes a gap. Step 5 delivers real measurements for the same intervals. Both are now in the
series and the document says only that samples are idempotent among themselves; it never says a gap
shares that keyspace.

The distinction the design missed is that **a gap in delivery is not a gap in measurement.** The
control plane knows one thing (nothing arrived) and the agent knows another (everything was
measured). Writing the first as though it were the second is exactly the interpolation error in
reverse: instead of inventing consumption that was never measured, it discards consumption that
was.

Patched into `15-observability.md` §2: a gap carries `(workload, resource, interval_start)` like
any other record and is superseded by a real sample for the same interval. A gap is a **claim about
the control plane's knowledge**, not a claim about the workload, and it is retracted when knowledge
arrives.

**FINDING 11: No metering period is ever closed. `CONFIRMED`**

Step 7 has no defined input. The billing system reads "the month", but nothing in Korpis says when
a month stops changing. Step 5 mutates intervals that a host may already have invoiced, and a
sample that arrives four days late mutates them again.

This is the same class of error as Finding 1. There, quota was checked without being held; here, a
period is read without being closed. In both cases the missing thing is a commitment point.

K-12 keeps Korpis out of billing, and that is still right, but a metering series with no notion of
finality is not a usable input to a billing system, it is a moving target. Korpis does not have to
issue invoices to owe its consumers a stated point after which numbers do not change.

Patched into `15-observability.md` §2: a `MeteringPeriod` closes on a declared boundary and a
declared lateness window. Samples arriving inside the window revise an open period; samples
arriving after it land in the next period as a dated adjustment, never as a silent edit of a closed
one.

**FINDING 12: The agent's metering buffer has no stated bound. `CONFIRMED`**

Step 2 assumes the agent can hold six hours. Nothing says it can hold six, or sixty, or what
happens at the limit. `14-streams.md` §3 bounds the console buffer explicitly and says what is
dropped and how the drop is marked; metering, which is the one stream with financial consequence,
has no such statement.

The absence is visible precisely because the neighbouring document does it properly.

Patched into `15-observability.md` §2: the buffer is bounded, the bound is declared, and exhausting
it produces a real gap with the cause `buffer exhausted`, which is the one case where a gap is a
statement about the workload and not only about the control plane's knowledge.

---

## 9. A customer restores one file from forty days ago

**Trace**

| # | Step | Governed by |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The customer opens a snapshot from forty days back and browses its manifest | `06-storage.md` §5.4 |
| 2 | The repository is scoped to their organization; dedup scope is the repository | `06-storage.md` §5.3 |
| 3 | They select one file; only the chunks it needs are fetched | `06-storage.md` §5.4 |
| 4 | Chunks decrypt client-side against a key held outside the repository | `06-storage.md` §5.3 |
| 5 | The read is an `Effect` and appears in the audit log | `15-observability.md` §4 |
| 6 | Restore lands in a **new** volume, which is the default presentation | `06-storage.md` §5.4 |

**FINDING 13: Browsing a manifest and reading a file are one grant and two disclosures.
`CONFIRMED`**

Step 1 reads the manifest. Step 3 reads content. `08-identity.md` §7 gates *backup contents* behind
an explicit grant, and the manifest is not contents; it is the tree. A support engineer holding
enough authority to help someone find a file can therefore enumerate every path, every filename and
every size in the volume, forty days of them, without holding the grant that gates a single byte.

For a game server the file tree is close to harmless. For a database volume, a mail spool, or a
customer's uploads directory, the tree is most of the disclosure. The design gated the expensive
half and left the informative half open.

Patched into `08-identity.md` §7 and `06-storage.md` §5.4: `backup.browse` and `backup.read` are
separate actions, browse is the weaker one, and neither implies the other. Both are audited as
sensitive reads.

**FINDING 14: A cross-tenant dedup scope is an operator decision, and the model does not say which
operator. `CONFIRMED`**

§5.3 is precise about the risk: a shared repository is a confirmation-of-file oracle, so the
default scope is the organization and sharing is "an explicit operator decision documented with
this consequence". Trace it through the reseller of §4 and the sentence stops working. In a
delegated tree every parent is an operator of its children. A reseller can put forty customers in
one repository and get a cheaper storage bill, and each customer can then test whether any other
customer holds a given file.

The decision is legitimate. What is missing is that the party who bears the consequence is not the
party who makes it, and Korpis knows which party is which.

This is Finding 7 again in a different subsystem, and the answer is the same shape: direction of
exposure decides who decides. Patched into `06-storage.md` §5.3: widening a dedup scope beyond one
organization requires the authority of the owner of every organization it will span, the same rule
§4.1 of `16-extensions.md` applies to providers, and the scope is visible to every tenant inside it
rather than being a fact about their data they cannot see.

### The same trace, run against Korpis' own backup

`18-operations.md` §6 separates tenant data from Korpis itself and lists what must be backed up.
Run steps 1 to 6 against that list and two things fall out.

**FINDING 15: Korpis' own backup can be stored in Korpis. `CONFIRMED`**

Nothing forbids putting the Postgres dump and the signing keys into a `Repository`, which is the
obvious thing to do because it is the backup system already in front of the operator. It is
client-side encrypted against a key whose reference lives in the database being backed up, so the
restore path needs the thing it is restoring.

Patched into `18-operations.md` §6: the control plane's own backup target is declared outside the
system it protects, the requirement is stated in the install preflight, and the encryption key for
it is material the operator holds, not a reference the database resolves.

**FINDING 16: "Rotate the signing key" does not say which key. `CONFIRMED`**

Restore step 2 rotates the key that capability tokens verify against. §3 of `18-operations.md`
enrolls a node by handing it "a per-node key pinned to the control plane's certificate". If those
are one key, disaster recovery ends with a fleet that cannot authenticate and an operator
re-enrolling every node by hand during the incident. If they are two, the restore is fine and
nobody wrote it down.

They should be two, and the reason is the same one that separated them everywhere else in this
design: node identity and delegated authority have different lifetimes and different revocation
stories. Patched into `18-operations.md` §6 and `08-identity.md` §6: the grant signing key and the
node identity certificate are distinct, restore rotates the first and preserves the second, and the
restore runbook of §8 says so in the step where an operator would otherwise find out.

## 10. The fix at 03:00, and the pipeline that runs at 09:00

**Trace**

| # | Step | Governed by |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | A workload is OOM-killing under load at 03:00. It belongs to a declared set, mode `advisory` | `13-surface-cli.md` §6 |
| 2 | An on-call operator raises its memory limit through the panel. The change is an ordinary `Intent` | `03-state.md` §3 |
| 3 | The set is marked **drifted**; the drift shows in the panel and in `korpis status` | `13-surface-cli.md` §6 |
| 4 | Admission holds quota against the new figure at the moment of the change | `05-scheduling.md` §5.1 |
| 5 | 09:00: CI runs `korpis apply -f servers/ --set community-servers` under a scoped token | `13-surface-cli.md` §7 |
| 6 | The Plan shows the drifted object as a change to be reconciled or adopted | `13-surface-cli.md` §6 |

**FINDING 17: A drifted intent makes declared and enforced differ, and quota holds only one of
them. `CONFIRMED`**

Step 4 is correct in isolation: quota consumption is written in the same transaction as the intent
(§5.1, Finding 1's patch). But `advisory` mode means the *declared* file still says 4 Gi while the
*enforced* cgroup says 8 Gi, and the drift can persist for weeks because that is what advisory is
for.

Which number is the tenant's quota holding? If the declared one, the organization is over its
guarantee and nothing says so. If the enforced one, the file is not the source of truth for quota
and a `plan` that shows no change to memory is nevertheless showing a quota that will move.

The design chose `advisory` deliberately and correctly. It did not notice that advisory drift makes
the two numbers a system was built to keep identical diverge on purpose.

Patched into `05-scheduling.md` §5.1: quota is held against the **enforced** value, always, because
quota is a statement about capacity and capacity is what the kernel is actually granting. A drifted
set therefore shows the quota delta in `korpis status` alongside the drift, so the 03:00 fix that
quietly consumed a reseller's headroom is visible the same morning rather than at the end of the
month.

**FINDING 18: A non-interactive apply meets a drifted object and has no defined outcome.
`CONFIRMED`**

Step 6 says the Plan shows the change "to be reconciled or adopted". Adoption means editing the
repository, which a CI runner cannot do and should not do. Reconciliation means discarding the
overnight fix, which is precisely what `advisory` exists to prevent. §7 calls CI the good case for
a scoped token and never says what CI does when it arrives at this Plan.

Three behaviours are defensible and the document picks none, which means implementations will pick
different ones and operators will learn which by being surprised.

Patched into `13-surface-cli.md` §6: an `advisory` set with drift **fails the apply and applies
nothing**, naming each drifted object and the `Effect` that caused the drift, and `--accept-drift`
proceeds while leaving the drifted objects untouched. A pipeline that goes red at 09:00 because a
human fixed something at 03:00 is the correct outcome: the fix survives, and the disagreement
between the file and reality is escalated to a person instead of being resolved by whichever ran
last.

## 11. The moderator loses the role

**Trace**

| # | Step | Governed by |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | A grant names *the `@moderator` role in guild 456* as its subject | `08-identity.md` §5 |
| 2 | A moderator uses it, and issues an attenuated child grant to a helper: restart one server, 7 days | `08-identity.md` §3.2 |
| 3 | They also open a console; a 120-second capability token is issued and renewed | `08-identity.md` §6 |
| 4 | They also create a share link, valid 24 hours, token in the fragment | `08-identity.md` §6.1 |
| 5 | The guild owner removes them from `@moderator` | Discord, outside Korpis |
| 6 | §5 says losing the role removes the authority with no deprovisioning step | `08-identity.md` §5 |

**FINDING 19: Losing an external role produces no event, so nothing cascades. `CONFIRMED`**

Step 6 is true of exactly one of steps 2, 3 and 4. The console token stops renewing within 120
seconds, which is the bound §6 promises and it holds.

The other two do not. §3.5 makes revocation cascade to the entire subtree, and that machinery runs
when a grant is revoked. Nothing was revoked here. Discord does not notify Korpis that a role
membership ended; the role assignment simply stops appearing in the next signed interaction, and if
that person never interacts again, Korpis never observes anything at all. So the helper's seven-day
child grant and the twenty-four-hour share link both keep working, issued by an authority that no
longer exists, and the audit trail shows a chain rooted in a subject who cannot use it.

"No deprovisioning step" was written as a feature and it is one. It is also the reason there is no
event, and the design read one half of that and not the other.

Patched into `08-identity.md` §5 and §3.5: an `ExternalIdentity` binding is **re-verified on a
declared interval**, not only when its holder happens to interact, and a binding that fails
re-verification enters `unverified`, which suspends every grant rooted in it and cascades exactly
as revocation does. Suspension rather than revocation because an identity provider being
unreachable must not silently destroy a delegation tree; `unverified` is visible, dated, and
reversible, and it fails closed for authority while failing loudly for the operator. The
re-verification interval is the honest analogue of token lifetime: it is the bound on how long
authority outlives its source, it is stated, and it is configurable rather than convenient.

## 12. A recipe install fails at step four of six

**Trace**

| # | Step | Governed by |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | An `Intent` names a recipe by digest, resolved once through the lockfile | `09-recipes.md` §8 |
| 2 | The Plan contains a step: run the recipe's install | `05-scheduling.md` §3.1 |
| 3 | The install DSL runs six steps: fetch, verify, extract, `steam.app`, template, chmod | `09-recipes.md` §4 |
| 4 | Step four calls an extension-provided step provider, which is circuit-broken | `16-extensions.md` §5 |
| 5 | The Plan step fails. The workload's state is `partial`, with the failed step attached | `05-scheduling.md` §3.1 |
| 6 | Resources created by completed steps are retained and named in the observation | `05-scheduling.md` §3.1 |
| 7 | The provider recovers; the plan resumes from the last completed step | `05-scheduling.md` §3.1 |

**FINDING 20: The install DSL's steps and a Plan's steps are different granularities, and the
resumability guarantee stops at the boundary. `CONFIRMED`**

Step 7 resumes from the last completed **Plan** step, and the whole install is one of those. So a
resume re-runs all six DSL steps, including a forty-gigabyte SteamCMD fetch that had already
succeeded, and the guarantee of §3.1 that a failed plan is "resumable, not restarted" is true of
the Plan and false of the thing the operator is actually waiting on.

Step 6 makes it worse rather than better. The partial install is retained, so the re-run of DSL
steps one to three is now operating on a directory that already has content, and §3.1's idempotence
guarantee was written for Plan steps, not for install verbs. `extract` over an existing tree and
`template` over an already-rendered file are the two most obvious ways to produce a workload that
starts and is subtly wrong.

Patched into `09-recipes.md` §4 and `05-scheduling.md` §3.1: install steps carry the same three
guarantees as Plan steps, ordered, individually idempotent, and resumable from the last completed
one, with progress recorded durably per install rather than per plan. The DSL's verbs are a closed
set precisely so that each can state its idempotence, which is a property this design already
needed and had only asserted one level up.

## 13. The edge fails, not the node

**Trace**

| # | Step | Governed by |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Two hundred workloads are exposed through one `stable` address on an edge | `07-networking.md` §3.1 |
| 2 | Thirty of them are hibernated and wake on connection | `22-first-party.md` §6 |
| 3 | The edge's forwarding plane stops passing traffic. Its host is up and its agent is healthy | `18-operations.md` §5 |
| 4 | Every node holding a workload is up, holds a valid lease, and reports `running` | `05-scheduling.md` §7 |
| 5 | The control plane observes nothing wrong, because nothing it observes is wrong | P4, `03-state.md` §5 |

**FINDING 21: The edge is the only component in the design that holds no lease. `CONFIRMED`**

Every other authority in Korpis is fenced. Agents hold leases with epochs, the control plane fences
on restore, migration cuts over at one instant under a lease. The edge forwards traffic for two
hundred workloads and holds nothing, so there is no mechanism by which a half-failed edge can be
detected as failed, and no mechanism by which a replacement can know the old one has stopped.

§11.2 of `07-networking.md` admitted the shape of this honestly: `stable` trades Pterodactyl's
distributed failure mode for a concentrated one. It did not follow the admission through to the
consequence, which is that the concentrated component is the one component with no health contract.

Step 5 is the part that should have been caught earlier. Every observation in the system is correct
and the service is down, which is the exact failure P4 was written to prevent, occurring in the one
place P4 was never applied.

Patched into `07-networking.md` §3.1 and `18-operations.md` §5: an edge holds a lease with an epoch
like any other data-plane component, and its liveness is **measured through the forwarding path**
rather than from the health of the process that owns it. Failover advances the epoch, and the
detection interval is declared, because an operator choosing a concentrated failure mode is
entitled to know how long the concentration lasts.

**FINDING 22: A hibernated workload's wake trigger lives in the failed component. `PLAUSIBLE`**

Step 2 crossed the same boundary and lands differently. Waking on connection requires something to
observe the connection, and that something is the edge. With the edge half-failed, thirty workloads
sit in `hibernated`, which is an accurate state, while being unreachable, which nothing reports,
because §6 of `22-first-party.md` deliberately never displays a hibernated workload as running and
therefore never displays it as down either.

Marked `PLAUSIBLE` rather than `CONFIRMED` because Finding 21's patch fixes the mechanism: an edge
with a measured forwarding path fails visibly, and its dependents become `unsatisfiable` with the
edge named. Recorded anyway, because it is the case that shows why the measurement has to be
through the forwarding path and not from the process.

## 14. A provider answers, slowly

**Trace**

| # | Step | Governed by |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | A workload declares an `ingress` endpoint needing a DNS record | `07-networking.md` §3.2 |
| 2 | The Plan's step calls the DNS provider extension, under a deadline | `16-extensions.md` §5 |
| 3 | The provider answers at 90% of the deadline, every time, for every workload in the fleet | `16-extensions.md` §5 |
| 4 | It never fails, so the circuit breaker never opens | `16-extensions.md` §5 |
| 5 | Every create in the fleet now takes the deadline, and the reconciler's queue grows | `05-scheduling.md` §7 |

**FINDING 23: The circuit breaker measures failure, and the failure mode is success. `CONFIRMED`**

§5 is careful about the two obvious cases: a provider that is unreachable and a provider that fails
consistently. Both are handled, and the reasoning for each is stated. Neither describes step 3,
where the provider is available, correct, and slow enough to consume the fleet's throughput while
producing no error to trip anything.

This is the classic degraded-dependency shape and it is worth stating plainly: **a deadline bounds
one call and says nothing about aggregate cost.** Two hundred calls at 90% of a five-second
deadline is fifteen minutes of reconciler time that no document accounts for, spent on third-party
code, with every observation reporting success.

Patched into `16-extensions.md` §5: provider latency is measured and published per provider, the
circuit breaker trips on sustained latency as well as on failure, and provider concurrency is
bounded per provider rather than per call so that one slow dependency cannot occupy the fleet's
reconciliation capacity. `15-observability.md` §5 gains the provider-degraded event, because the
operator whose creates got slow this morning should not have to infer the cause from a graph.

**One thing this trace did not find**, and it is worth recording because it was the suspicion that
motivated the trace: the tenant boundary holds. A provider installed by one tenant is bounded by
the scope of the grants it was installed with (§4.1 of `16-extensions.md`), so a slow
tenant-installed provider degrades that tenant's own reconciliation and nobody else's. The finding
above applies to providers installed at the operator level, which is the case §2 calls "core uses
the same mechanism", and that is the price of having made core and extensions the same thing.

**What the second seven traces cost, and what they bought.** They took a paragraph each to write
and produced fourteen findings, four of which (11, 16, 19, 21) are the kind that are discovered in
production by a customer, an auditor, or an outage rather than by a maintainer.

Findings 1, 6, 9, 16, 19, and 21 are the ones that would have cost real money to discover late. An
overshot quota is a support ticket. An unstated overcommit model is a reseller telling their
customers something Korpis does not do. A resurrected grant is a security incident with no audit
trail. Rotating the wrong key turns a recovery into a fleet-wide re-enrollment during the incident.
An external role that is removed without cascading is authority nobody can see. An unfenced edge is
two hundred workloads down while every observation reports healthy.

All six were found by the same method, following one concrete story across a boundary that two
documents each believed the other was holding. None of them is subtle in hindsight, which is the
point: they were invisible per document and obvious per trace.

---

## 16. An external review, and what it found

The fourteen traces above are one method: follow a concrete story until it crosses a boundary
nobody owns. In August 2026 the specification was also read by a different model with a different
method, which attacked the **algebra** inside each document rather than the seams between them. It
found nineteen things. Sixteen were real and are patched; one had been closed hours earlier by
Finding 19 above and the reviewer could not see it; two were already partly answered.

Recording it here, in full, because §2 of `01-model.md` set the rule that corrections stay visible,
and because the split between what the two methods caught is the most useful thing in this
document.

### What the two methods caught, and why it differs

The traces found **seam** defects: two documents each believing the other held something. The
review found **algebra** defects: a single document asserting a property its own definitions cannot
support. Almost nothing appears on both lists, and the one thing that does, R1 and Finding 19, was
reached from opposite directions on the same day.

R2 is the clearest example and the most uncomfortable. Trace §1 follows a share link with
`max_uses: 3` three separate times and never asks who holds the counter. A trace verifies that each
step has an owner; it does not verify that a step is *possible*. The document that lectures every
other document about displaying only what is enforced was displaying a limit nothing enforced, and
it took someone reading the definitions rather than following the story.

R11 is the same shape. "Advance past the watermark" reads correctly in sequence and is
arithmetically insufficient, and no trace catches that, because a trace confirms a step exists
rather than checking its maths.

The practical conclusion is written into `CLAUDE.md`: **traces and algebra review are different
instruments and a document needs both.** A change that adds a field, a condition, or a limit gets
the algebra question asked of it directly, which is "what evaluates this, where, and with what
information", and the answer has to name a component that actually has that information.

### What was not accepted

Two claims did not survive checking, and saying so matters as much as the rest.

The review argued that the gateway becomes "the single bottleneck" as well as the single
authorization point. It is the single authorization point by design (P6), and that part stands. It
is not a bottleneck: the gateway is stateless and horizontally scaled with no leader (§5 of
`18-operations.md`), so the cost is throughput, not a serialization point. The invalidation gap
underneath the argument was real and is fixed; the conclusion drawn from it was not.

The review also suspected that `stable` puts a permanent hop in front of UDP game traffic. §4 of
`07-networking.md` already had the edge co-resident with kernel-level forwarding for exactly this
reason. What was genuinely missing was the word "default", which is now there, along with the
statement that a remote edge is a deliberate choice with a stated cost.

The reviewer flagged three findings as unverifiable because they could not read
`02-architecture.md`, `17-security.md`, or this document. Checked against those files: R5 was
correct, §5 did specify no caching design at all; R11 was correct; R18 was half correct as above.
